# @arethetypeswrong/core

## 0.12.0

### Minor Changes

- a578211: - Refactor internal checks API. This fixes duplication of some problems from the problems array, instead ensuring a single problem instance is visible from each relevant resolution.
  - Improve problem type API. Renames many fields on individual problem types.
  - Move module kind data off of `EntrypointResolutionAnalysis` and onto a top-level map in `programInfo`, a new top-level field on `Analysis`.
  - Remove `Wildcard` problem kind.

## 0.10.2

### Patch Changes

- eecbf74: Fix issue with resolving DefinitelyTyped versions

## 0.10.1

### Patch Changes

- ae2426f: Fixed bug that could cause a crash while checking for FalseExportDefault

## 0.10.0

### Minor Changes

- 30bdb07: New problem kind: **Missing `export =`**

  Previously, `FalseExportDefault` had many cases of false positives where the JavaScript assigned an object to `module.exports`, and that object had a `default` property pointing back to itself. This pattern is not a true `FalseExportDefault`, but it is still problematic if the types only declare an `export default`. These kinds of false positives of `FalseExportDefault` are now instead reported as `MissingExportEquals`.

  Additionally, `FalseExportDefault` was only ever reported as being visible in `node16-esm`, but this was incorrect. The consequences are most likely to be visible in `node16-esm`, but the problem is fundamentally independent of the module resolution mode, and inaccuracies can be observed in other modes as well, especially when `esModuleInterop` is not enabled.

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- c3a69f7: Package creation API changes to support @arethetypeswrong/history better. `createPackageFromNpm` options now take a `before` property similar to `npm install --before date`.
- 2c67f2d: Add `buildTools` property to `Analysis` (a pick of `devDependencies`)

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- 894d0f3: Add support for DefinitelyTyped analysis.

  - `createPackageFromNpm` now takes an options parameter that can control DefinitelyTyped inclusion.
  - The `Package` type is now a class, with new properties and methods:
    - `typesPackage` contains the package name and version for the included DefinitelyTyped package, if any.
    - `mergedWithTypes(typesPackage: Package)` returns a new `Package` instance with all files from both packages and the `typesPackage` instance property metadata filled in.
  - `createPackageFromTarballData` is no longer asynchronous.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- 2c03c4a: - Fix a bug in `filterProblems` that caused CJSOnlyExportsDefault not to be identified
  - Change the `kind` property in `filterProblems` to take an array of problem kinds

### Patch Changes

- c8993b9: Fix a false positive of FalseExportDefault on packages that assign both to module.exports and module.exports.default

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- eae544d: Add `options` parameter to `checkPackage` with support for customizing which entrypoints get analyzed.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 8b098c0: Changed `checkPackage` signature to accept a package FS as created by new `createPackageFromNpm`, `createPackageFromTarballUrl`, or `createPackageFromTarballData` functions. `createPackageFromNpm` resolves version ranges.

## 0.4.1

### Patch Changes

- 27ad5a7: Expose parsePackageSpec in @arethetypeswrong/core/utils

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 7c3a377: If a packages has no `exports` field, look for additional entry points marked by extra `package.json` files with a `"main"` field in subdirectories.
- 53e031b: Inlined `InternalResolutionErrorDetails` into `InternalResolutionError` and renamed the interface to `InternalResolutionErrorProblem` to match other problem interfaces

### Patch Changes

- 53e031b: Fixed an issue where InternalResolutionError and UnexpectedModuleSyntax could be duplicated
- 53e031b: Fixed an issue where InternalResolutionError was missing traces

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 6fc935a: Added links to new documentation for each problem kind

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- d107355:
  - New problem kind: **Internal resolution error** indicates that an import in one of the packageâ€™s type declaration files failed to resolve. Either this indicates that runtime resolution errors will occur, or (more likely) the types misrepresent the contents of the JavaScript files.
  - Significant API changes. Most significantly, problems are returned as part of `checkPackage`, and `summarizeProblems`/`getSummarizedProblems` have been replaced by a collection of utilities for grouping and filtering problems.

## 0.0.6

- Fixed an error processing some packages due to different tarball metadata

## 0.0.5

- API additions: added `packageVersion` property to `TypedAnalysis` and `UntypedAnalysis` and added `packageName` to `UntypedAnalysis`

## 0.0.4

- New problem kind: **Syntax is incompatible with detected module kind.**

## 0.0.3

- Fixed a bug where 0-byte files in tarballs were interpreted as non-existent.

## 0.0.2

- New problem kind: **Resolved through a fallback condition.**
- Fixed a bug where the ESM/CJS module kind could be inaccurate for `.d.cts`, `.d.mts`, and `.json` files.

## 0.0.1

- Added CHANGELOG
- New problem kind: **CJS module uses a default export.**
- New problem kind: **Types incorrectly use a default export.**
